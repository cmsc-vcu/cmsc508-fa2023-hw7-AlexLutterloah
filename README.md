# Homework 7 - Creating a database

## Project Description

In this project we're creating a database for a company that needs to capture data pertaining to skills, employees, and roles within the company. This will allow for easy searching of employees with specific skillsets, skill listings per employee, and to see skill sets of employees in certain roles.

To create the database, we use a SQL DDL file, creating and populating each table individually. Which is then accessed and queried by using Python in Quarto.
